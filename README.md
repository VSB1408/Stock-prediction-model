# Stock-prediction-model
Basic stock prediction model built using Machine Learning 

STEP1 - Collect and store stock data                                   
STEP2 - Preprocess data by dividing into Train & Test parts                              
STEP3 - Build a stacked LSTM model                                        
STEP4 - Try the train and test data on the LSTM model                          
STEP5 - Predict the next 30 days output using the model
